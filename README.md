# PresetMake

## Welcome To PresetMake!

### What is this?
PresetMake is a python CLI app that allows the programmer to swap chunks of code while still maintaining readablitiy. 

### Why?
I created this in order to be able to switch out different versions code without compromising on the reading flow oof the program. For example,commenting and uncommenting out code to test can be cumbersome and annoying, I would simply load and unload presets that will fix themselves into the specified lines in code and automatically remove the previous code. In development phase, this program can be used to test out similar pieces of code into the same position. 
### Usage 
```
python exec.py <name of file to edit> -<option>
```
