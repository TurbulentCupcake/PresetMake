# PresetMake

## Welcome To PresetMake!

### What is this?
PresetMake is a python CLI app that allows the programmer to swap chunks of code while still maintaining readablitiy. 

### Why?
I created this in order to be able to switch out different versions of the same code without compromising on the reading flow of the program.
